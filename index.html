<h2>About Me</h2>
<p><b>I have a passion for fitness and personal development, which I have followed consistently through 10+ years <br> of gym training and 12+ years of playing ice hockey at an elite level. This has given me the skills to set and <br> achieve goals and to work together towards a common goal. Therefore, I consider myself a loyal team player <br> who is good at working together.  
<br> </p> <p>
    Recently, I made the decision to switch careers and start studying to become a <br> front-end developer with the short-term goal of continuous learning and the long-term goal of one day becoming a <br> full-stack developer. With my discipline and determination I know I will succeed. </p>
    When I was 15 years old, my family moved to Spain, which was an important experience in my life. <br> During the two years I lived there, I had the opportunity to improve my communication and understanding of languages other than Swedish. <br> I worked both as a construction worker and as a bartender in my spare time.</b></p>
